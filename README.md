# hexo-tag-hint

`hexo-tag-hint` is a plugin that parses `hint` tags,  which translate into a normal post content but will additionally show up a floating tooltip containing preset hint text when getting **hovered** or clicked. It's achieved by wrapping around and slightly adjusting the [`hint.css`](https://github.com/chinchang/hint.css) pure-css tooltip library.
